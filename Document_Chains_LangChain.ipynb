They also discuss the fleeting nature of all things and the insignificance of material possessions in the grand scheme of the universe. The concept of death and one's own mortality is explored, with the reminder that it is a natural part of life and should not be feared. The author urges readers to consider their place in the universe and connection to a higher power, and to live in accordance with their true nature while avoiding negative emotions and sentiments towards others. They also highlight the dangers of allowing oneself to be consumed by anger, desire, or pleasure without consideration for the common good. The brevity and uncertainty of life is emphasized, and the author encourages readers to make the most of each moment through philosophy, which involves preserving one's spirit, embracing all experiences, and accepting death as a natural part of the cycle of life. \n"

      "\n",
      " The writer reflects on the influence of his mentor, Claudius Maximus, who taught him about the importance of justice and equality in a commonwealth, the welfare of subjects in a kingdom, and the consistent pursuit of philosophy. Maximus also taught him to be self-reliant and resilient in the face of challenges, to value moderation and seriousness, and to approach all tasks with diligence and a positive attitude.

      " The universe takes care of the world and allows humans to have control over avoiding truly evil things like vice and wickedness. It is not capable of preventing or ordering these things, but they do not define a person's character. All things in life, such as life and death, honor and dishonor, are neutral and do not have a moral value. Everything in the world is temporary and will eventually dissolve into the substance and time of the world. It is important to reflect on the nature of worldly things.\"\n",
